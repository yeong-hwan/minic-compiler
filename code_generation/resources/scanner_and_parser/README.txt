In case your scanner and parser do not work properly, you can use the class
files in this subdirectory instead with Assignment 5. The provided classfiles
are Scanner.class, Parser.class and MiniC.class. You must use *all* classfiles,
otherwise scanner and parser wonâ€™t work.

See the Assignment 5 specification on how to compile with gradle to use
these provided classfiles.

# minic-compiler

## Introduction
**Mini C** is complete subset of **ANSI C**
> Mini C was devised by reducing several language structures from the existing ANSI C grammar. The overall program structure is similar, but there is only an integer type in the data type, and no structure such as multiple arrangements exists. In addition, bit-related operators were excluded. However, in general, it is thought that there is a great educational effect in designing experimental compilers.

### MiniC Language Specification

## How to run

```zsh
# build
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```


### Scanner
This scanner read a character stream from a MiniC source file and translate it to a sequence of MiniC tokens.
This is known as the lexical analysis part of a compiler.

**[Scanner Description](docs/descriptions/scanner_description.md)**

```zsh
# running and testing scanner
java -jar build/libs/MiniC-Scanner.jar {input-path}

# example
java -jar build/libs/MiniC-Scanner.jar MiniC/Scanner/tst/base/testcases/c1.txt

# redirect the output of scanner to a file
java â€“jar build/libs/MiniC-Scanner.jar {input-path} > {output-path}
```


### Parser
A recursive descent parser (RD parser) for MiniC.
(only check the syntactic correctness of the input program)

**[Parser Description](docs/descriptions/parser_description.md)**

```zsh
# build for parser(Recommended)
./gradlew jarNoScanner

# running and testing parser
java -jar {input-path}

# example
java -jar build/libs/MiniC-Parser.jar MiniC/Parser/tst/base/testcases/c1.txt
```
jarNoScanner: sacnning with perfect scanner on library
jar: scanning with custom scanner


### AST Generation
Extend recursive descent parser to produce Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for MiniC. 
If a program is syntactically legal, then the parser must build the AST for the program. Otherwise the parser can print any error message and exit without completing the AST for the illegal input program.

# minic-compiler

## Introduction
**Mini C** is complete subset of **ANSI C**
> Mini C was devised by reducing several language structures from the existing ANSI C grammar. The overall program structure is similar, but there is only an integer type in the data type, and no structure such as multiple arrangements exists. In addition, bit-related operators were excluded. However, in general, it is thought that there is a great educational effect in designing experimental compilers.
